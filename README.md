# Cube Puzzle

Here's the task:

```
If a special cuboid dice of dimensions 2cm x 1.2cm x 1.2cm with 5 black and one white side is repeatedly rolled, what is the probability that the white side ends up on top?
Assume the white side is one of the larger ones.
```

For the moment, LLMs fail horribly at this task, so I built a physics simulation using THREE and Cannon.js

Here's the demo: [https://apexys.github.io/cube_puzzle/cube_puzzle.html](https://apexys.github.io/cube_puzzle/cube_puzzle.html)
